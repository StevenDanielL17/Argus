# Builder Program

Pacifica's builder program allows third-party developers (“builders”) to earn fees for orders they send on behalf of the users. These must be **approved by the user** before they can be used on any order. Once approved, the builder may include the code in any supported order creation request. Users can revoke access at any time.

Builder codes affect only Pacifica’s order fee logic and are fully verified by the API according to user approval, fee limits, and builder configuration.\
\
We’re setting aside **up to a total of 10,000,000 points** over the next **three months** to reward teams building on Pacifica with Builder Program **(December 11th, 2025 → March 11th, 2026)**.

**Builder Program Rewards** will be distributed based on each team’s contribution to Pacifica’s growth. To ensure fairness and meaningful impact within the ecosystem, an evaluation process will be conducted. Only teams that make significant contributions to Pacifica’s development will be eligible to receive point rewards.

### Step 1: Request User Authorization

Request the user to authorize placing orders with your builder code by prompting them to sign an approval request containing your builder code as `builder_code` and the additional fee rate you want to charge as `max_fee_rate`.

**Important:** The user's `max_fee_rate` must be greater than or equal to your builder's `fee_rate`. If they set a lower value, orders will be rejected.

**Data to be Signed**

To approve a builder code, the user signs:

```json
{
    "timestamp": <ms>,
    "expiry_window": 5000,
    "type": "approve_builder_code",
    "data": {
        "builder_code": "YOUR_CODE",
        "max_fee_rate": "0.001"
    }
}
```

After following the [signing implementation](https://docs.pacifica.fi/api-documentation/api/signing/implementation), compact and sort this payload recursively to generate the signature.

**Complete Payload (After Signing)**

```

    "account": "6ETn....",
    "agent_wallet": null,
    "signature": "5j1Vy9UqYUF2jKD9r2Lv5AoMWHJuW5a1mqVzEhC9SJL5GqbPkGEQKpW3UZmKXr4UWrHMJ5xHQFMJkZWE8J5VyA",

    "expiry_window": 5000,
    "builder_code": "YOUR_CODE",
    "max_fee_rate": "0.001"
}
```

**Endpoint:** `POST https://api.pacifica.fi/api/v1/account/builder_codes/approve`

**Check User Approvals (Optional)**

You can query which builder codes a user has approved:

**Endpoint:** `GET https://api.pacifica.fi/api/v1/account/builder_codes/approvals?account=6ETn....`

**Response:**

```
[
  {
    "builder_code": "YOUR_CODE",
    "description": "Test Builder Integration",
    "max_fee_rate": "0.001",
    "updated_at": 1748970123456
  }
]
```

**Revoke Builder Code Authorization (Optional)**

Users can revoke authorization at any time:

}
```

**Endpoint:** `POST https://api.pacifica.fi/api/v1/account/builder_codes/revoke`<br>

### **Step 2: Include Builder Code in Order Creation Requests**

All order creation requests may now include your builder code in the `builder_code` parameter. Update the following endpoints:

**REST API:**

* `POST /api/v1/orders/create_market`
* `POST /api/v1/orders/create`
* `POST /api/v1/orders/stop/create`
* `POST /api/v1/positions/tpsl`

**WebSocket:**

* `create_market_order`
* `create_limit_order`
* `create_stop_order`
* `set_position_tpsl`

**Example: Create Market Order with Builder Code**

}
```

**Endpoint:** `POST https://api.pacifica.fi/api/v1/positions/tpsl`

**Note:** `builder_code` is provided only at the top level for TP/SL creation, not within individual `take_profit` or `stop_loss` objects.<br>

### Implementation Notes

* **Signature Generation:** Follow the standard [signing implementation](https://docs.pacifica.fi/api-documentation/api/signing/implementation) for all requests
* **Builder Code Placement:** The `builder_code` must be included in the `data` object when creating the payload to be signed
* **Recursive Sorting:** All JSON keys must be recursively sorted alphabetically before creating the compact JSON string
* **Timestamps:** All times are in milliseconds
* **Expiry Window:** Defaults to 30 seconds (30,000 ms) if not specified
* **Backwards Compatibility:** The `builder_code` field is optional on all order creation endpoints
* **Validation:** Orders with builder codes will be rejected if:
  * The builder code doesn't exist
  * The user hasn't approved the builder code
  * The user's `max_fee_rate` is less than the builder's `fee_rate`

### Update Builder Code Fee Rate

Update the fee rate for your builder code. This endpoint is for builder account owners to change the fee they charge on orders sent with their builder code.\
\
**Request User Authorization (Sign & Send)**\
Builder account owner to sign an update containing the builder code and the new fee rate.<br>

**Data to be Signed**

```
{
    "timestamp": <ms>,
    "expiry_window": 5000,
    "type": "update_builder_code_fee_rate",
    "data": {
        "builder_code": "YOUR_CODE",
        "fee_rate": "0.05"
    }
}
```

**Complete Payload (After Signing)**

```
{
    "account": "6ETn....",
    "agent_wallet": null,
    "signature": "5j1V.....",
    "timestamp": 1748970123456,
    "expiry_window": 5000,
    "builder_code": "YOUR_CODE",
    "fee_rate": "0.05"
}
```

**Endpoints:** `POST https://api.pacifica.fi/api/v1/builder/update_fee_rate`

### Referral Code Claim <a href="#referral-code-claim" id="referral-code-claim"></a>

Users can claim a referral code to establish a referral relationship with the code's owner. Referral codes can optionally generate and claim access codes automatically, providing both referral tracking and whitelist access in one action.

#### How It Works

**Step 1: Request User Authorization**

Request the user to authorize claiming a referral code by prompting them to sign an approval request containing the referral code.

**Data to be Signed**

```
{
    "timestamp": <ms>,
    "expiry_window": 5000,
    "type": "claim_referral_code",
    "data": {
        "code": "YOUR_CODE"
    }
}
```

After following the signing implementation, compact and sort this payload recursively to generate the signature.

**Complete Payload (After Signing)**

```
{
    "account": "6ETn....",
    "agent_wallet": null,
    "signature": "5jHM.....",
    "timestamp": 1748970123456,
    "expiry_window": 5000,
    "code": "YOUR_CODE"
}
```

**Endpoint:** `POST https://api.pacifica.fi/api/v1/referral/user/code/claim`

### **Useful Endpoints**

* User trade history via specific builder code: <mark style="color:$primary;">`https://api.pacifica.fi/api/v1/trades/history?account=[WALLET_ADDRESS]&builder_code=[BUILDER_CODE]`</mark>
* Builder Code Specifications: <mark style="color:$primary;">`https://api.pacifica.fi/api/v1/builder/overview?account=[WALLET_ADDRESS]`</mark>
* Builder Trade History: <mark style="color:$primary;">`https://api.pacifica.fi/api/v1/builder/trades?builder_code=[BUILDER_CODE]`</mark>
* Builder Code User Leaderboard: <mark style="color:$primary;">`https://api.pacifica.fi/api/v1/leaderboard/builder_code?builder_code=[BUILDER_CODE]`</mark>

### Error Handling

**Common Error Codes:**

* `403 Unauthorized`: User hasn't approved the builder code or `max_fee_rate` is too low
* `404 Not Found`: Builder code doesn't exist
* `400 Bad Request`: Invalid builder code format (must be alphanumeric, max 16 characters)
